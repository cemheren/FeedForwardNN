# FeedForwardNN
A feed forward neural network example in c# for people with developer background. This repo is not concerned with performance, rather it's here for educational purposes with better class hierarchy and clear code. 

It contains several examples for different tasks that can be achieved with a feed forward network. 
For the mnist example you need to unzip the mnist.zip file in the root folder and point to it from code.
